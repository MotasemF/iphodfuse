  <iphod.Regular>
    Dearly beloved, the Scriptures teach us to acknowledge our many sins and offenses, not concealing them from our heavenly Father, but confessing them with humble and obedient hearts that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy. We ought at all times humbly to acknowledge our sins before Almighty God, but especially when we come together in his presence to give thanks for the great benefits we have received at his hands, to declare his most worthy praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and others, those things necessary for our life and our salvation. Therefore, come with me to the throne of heavenly grace.

    Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,desires not the death of sinners, 
    but that they may turn from their wickedness and live. He has empowered and commanded his   
    ministers to pronounce to his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of 
    their sins. He pardons all who truly repent and genuinely believe his holy Gospel. 
    For this reason, we beseech him to grant us true repentance and his Holy Spirit, that 
    our present deeds may please him, the rest of our lives may be pure and holy, and that at  
    the last we may come to his eternal joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

    Grant your faithful people, merciful Lord, pardon and peace; that we may be cleansed 
    from all our sins, and serve you with a quiet mind; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
